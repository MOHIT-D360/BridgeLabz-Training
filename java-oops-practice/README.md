🗓 Day 9 – Classes & Objects

Date: 26-Dec-2025

On this day, I explored the fundamentals of Classes and Objects in Java.
I learned how to define a class and create objects from it.
Practiced accessing class variables and methods using object references.
Implemented real-world based programs such as Student and Employee to strengthen understanding.
All programs were committed and pushed to GitHub successfully.

🗓 Day 10 – Constructors & Access Specifiers

Date: 27-Dec-2025

Studied the concept of constructors and their importance in initializing objects.
Created multiple programs using parameterized and default constructors.
Understood different access specifiers (public, private, default, protected) and their scope.
Implemented examples to demonstrate access control in Java classes.
Changes were committed and pushed successfully.

🗓 Day 11 – this, static, final Keywords & instanceof Operator

Date: 29-Dec-2025

Learned how the this keyword is used to refer to the current object.
Understood the behavior and use cases of static and final keywords.
Practiced programs using static variables and static methods.
Implemented examples demonstrating the instanceof operator.
All implementations were committed and pushed to the repository.

🗓 Day 12 – Inheritance

Date: 30-Dec-2025

On this day, I studied the concept of Inheritance in Java.
Learned how one class can acquire properties and methods of another class using the extends keyword.
Practiced examples based on single-level inheritance using real-world scenarios.
Understood the use of super keyword to access parent class constructors and methods.
All programs were committed and pushed successfully.

🗓 Day 13 – Encapsulation

Date: 31-Dec-2025

Studied the principle of Encapsulation and its role in data protection.
Learned how to restrict direct access to variables using private access modifier.
Implemented getter and setter methods to control data access.
Practiced programs demonstrating secure class design following encapsulation principles.
All changes were committed and pushed to GitHub.

🗓 Day 14 – Object Modelling

Date: 01-Jan-2026

On this day, I learned about Object Modelling in Java.
Understood how to convert real-world entities into classes and objects.
Designed object models by identifying attributes and behaviors.
Implemented programs based on real-life systems using proper class structure.
Code was reviewed, committed, and pushed successfully.
